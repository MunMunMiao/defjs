## Introduction

`def` is an abbreviation for `define`, so it can be read as `define js`.

Defjs is a TypeScript library for defining typed HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket APIs over standard Web APIs.

- Typed HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket command definitions.
- Runtime validation and full TypeScript inference.
- Streaming support.
- Interceptor support.
- Works in browser and server applications that provide the required platform transports.
- Bun `1.4.0` is the repository's only development, test, build, packaging, and publishing runtime.
- ESM. `@defjs/core` declares no runtime dependencies.

## Quick Start

Install the core package in your application:

```sh
bun add @defjs/core
```

Use the documentation and release notes that match the version installed in your project.

```ts
import { createClient, defineRequest, struct, withEndpoint } from '@defjs/core'

const client = createClient(withEndpoint('https://api.example.com'))

const getUser = defineRequest({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/v1/users/:id',
  input: struct.request({
    path: struct.object({
      id: struct.number(),
    }),
  }),
  output: [
    { status: 200, body: struct.object({ id: struct.number(), name: struct.string() }) },
    { status: 404, body: struct.object({ message: struct.string() }) },
  ],
})

const [error, user] = await client.execute(getUser({ path: { id: 1 } }))
if (error) {
  console.error(error.kind, error.code)
} else {
  console.log(user.name)
}
```

## Documentation

The full guides live in `doc/` and cover HTTP, SSE, WebSocket, Structs, interceptors, errors, React, Vue, and server-side OpenTelemetry integration.

- Each package tarball keeps its package `README.md` and the repository `LICENSE`; repository-wide guides and examples are not packed.
- Contributors working from the current checkout can start with `doc/guide/getting-started.md`; these source docs can describe unreleased changes.
- Choose one of the 11 language tracks from the documentation site.
- Match the documentation to the package version installed in your application.

## Repository packages

| Package                                                        | Purpose                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@defjs/core`](packages/core)                                 | Typed HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket client definitions and execution.                             |
| [`@defjs/react`](packages/react)                               | React thin adapter for sharing a typed core client through `ClientProvider` and `useClient`. |
| [`@defjs/vue`](packages/vue)                                   | Vue thin adapter for providing and injecting a typed core client.                            |
| [`@defjs/opentelemetry-server`](packages/opentelemetry-server) | Server-side outbound OpenTelemetry instrumentation for core clients.                         |

## Repository tasks

Repository commands are classified by scope. A command being exposed at the root does not mean every workspace should implement it.

| Scope                          | Commands                                                                                 | Execution model                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository-wide checks         | `bun run verify`, `bun run fmt`, `bun run fmt:check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run lint:fix` | `verify` is the complete CI and local pre-release gate, including packed-consumer verification.      |
| Workspace aggregation          | `bun run test`, `bun run build`                                                          | The root delegates to workspace-owned tasks; `build` first runs the repository-wide type check once. |
| Workspace-local lifecycle      | Package `build`/`test`, documentation `build`                                            | Each workspace handles only its own tests or output.                                                 |
| Explicit, on-demand operations | `bun run test:release`, `bun run test:packed`, documentation `dev`/`preview`             | Focused checks remain available when the full gate is unnecessary.                                   |

Formatting, linting, and TypeScript checking are repository-wide gates. Workspace manifests must not duplicate them, and CI must not invoke them through `bun run --workspaces`, `--filter`, or per-package filters.

Tests and builds are intentionally different. Their environments, configurations, and outputs belong to specific workspaces, so the root commands aggregate the relevant workspace lifecycle scripts.

## Release workflow

Package versions live in their own manifests and advance independently. The repository does not use generated changeset files or coordinated workspace version bumps.

Push one package-specific tag after its manifest version is merged to `main`:

- `release-core-vX.Y.Z`
- `release-opentelemetry-server-vX.Y.Z`
- `release-react-vX.Y.Z`
- `release-vue-vX.Y.Z`

CI runs the full Bun verification gate on pull requests and `main`. The release workflow runs `bun ci`, validates the tag and selected manifest through `release-target.ts`, runs `bun --bun run build` only for that package, and publishes from its `dist` directory. It relies on successful `main` CI plus protected release tags and the `npm` environment. A Core patch within the adapters' `^0.4.0` peer range, such as `0.4.0` to `0.4.3`, does not require another adapter release; publish an adapter only when its own artifact, implementation, public metadata, or peer range changes.

### Dependency ownership

- The repository root owns repository-wide gates, root-shared test sources, and CI test bootstrap tools.
- Each workspace directly owns its build and test tools and any required peer dependencies.
- The same version declared by multiple workspaces is not incorrect duplication when each owner actually uses it.

## Status and Roadmap

### Implemented in this repository source today

- Typed HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket command definitions in `@defjs/core`.
- Thin framework adapters for React and Vue.
- Server-side outbound OpenTelemetry instrumentation for defjs clients.
- Documentation source and local VitePress tooling in `doc/`.

See the package READMEs and the metadata for the published releases you install to confirm exact npm availability and API surface.

### Planned

- CLI tool.
- Generate API definitions from OpenAPI.
- Generate full SDK packages for larger API surfaces.

### Non-goals / boundaries

- Framework adapters are not query/cache/state libraries.
- OpenTelemetry integration does not initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK for you.
- Request/response bodies, full headers, raw query strings, and stream/message payloads are not captured by default.
- CLI and code generation are not delivered packages yet.

## Adoption note

Repository development baseline: Bun `1.4.0`.

These values describe this repository's contributor baseline, not a blanket requirement for every consumer application that installs a published package.

Most defjs packages are still evolving before stable 1.0; overall API may evolve.
